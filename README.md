Introduction

The MyThread library is a simple thread management system implemented in C. It provides basic functionalities for creating, running, and managing threads with priorities.
The library includes support for mutexes (for critical section protection) and condition variables (for waiting on specific conditions).


Features


Thread Management: Create, run, and manage threads with different priorities.

Mutexes: Lock and unlock critical sections to ensure mutual exclusion.

Condition Variables: Wait and signal specific conditions for thread synchronization.

Scheduler: Simple priority-based thread scheduler.

Conclusion

The Threadlibrary provides basic threading capabilities with priority scheduling, mutexes, and condition variables. 
It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate fundamental concepts of thread management and synchronization in C. 
For production use, consider more robust threading libraries or built-in threading support provided by the operating system.
